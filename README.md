## How do I put my computer on my Desktop?

Desktop shortcuts are the shortcuts of a particular file present inside the complex folders and drives on the computer. Through desktop shortcuts, applications can be opened easily just on a click. Desktop shortcuts reduce the need to access your applications from the original file location and thus saving your precious and valuable time. Here are the steps to create desktop shortcuts:

### Using the Desktop Menu

* Right-click anywhere in the free space present on your desktop. Point to New option from the dialog box.
* Look for a new window asking you to browse the location of the file for which you want to create the shortcut. You must choose the browse option and browse the file location. As soon as you choose the location, the box will be filled itself by the location.
* Click Next option present somewhere at the right-bottom of the working window.
* Type a name for the shortcut. If a Finish button appears at the bottom of the dialog box, click it. If a Next button appears at the bottom of the dialog box, click it, choose the icon you want to use for your shortcut, and then click Finish.

### Using the File Location

* Locate the file or application for which you want to create the shortcut.
* Right click on that particular file or application for which you want to create the shortcut. Make sure to select the file before right-clicking.
* Look for a dialog box. From there, choose the "'Create Shortcut'" option.
* Drag the shortcut to the desktop. You can now easily access your application with just a click.

## What is ‘My Computer’ good for?

My Computer used to be the go-to space for anyone wanting to explore their computer drives and manage the content on them. But apart from that, it also provided a way to get to the ‘System Information’ page quickly (by right-clicking and selecting ‘Properties’). These two things in conjunction made ‘My Computer’ the gateway to your entire computer, including all the drives and system information. This is why it was (and still is) perhaps one of the most important elements for a Windows user.
